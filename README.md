### Desktop Application for the project "Multimodal Medical Image Fusion To Detect Brain Tumors"

Diagnostic tools include **Computed tomography (CT)** and **Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)** and thus these are the two modalities that we will consider for Image Fusion Process. 
We aim to approach a three step process:
1. Image Registeration
2. Image Fusion
3. Image Segmentation

***

All the above functionalities have also been implemented on a Website using Flask and Python Scripts.
